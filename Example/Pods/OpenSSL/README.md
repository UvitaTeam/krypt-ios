## Apple's stance on OpenSSL

>macOS includes a low-level command-line interface to the OpenSSL open-source cryptography toolkit; this interface is not available in iOS.
>
>Although OpenSSL is commonly used in the open source community, it doesnâ€™t provide a stable API from version to version. For this reason, the programmatic interface to OpenSSL is deprecated in macOS and is not provided in iOS. Use of the Apple-provided OpenSSL libraries by apps is strongly discouraged.
>
>**To ensure compatibility, if your app depends on OpenSSL, you should compile it yourself and statically link a known version of OpenSSL into your app. Such use works on both iOS and macOS.**
>
>In general, however, you should use the CFNetwork API for secure networking and the Certificate, Key, and Trust Services API for cryptographic services. Alternatively, in macOS, you can use the Secure Transport API.
